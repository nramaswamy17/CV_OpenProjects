Computer Vision Project

Stores all Computer Vision projects I've worked on, which are separated into 3 categories:

Easy - Monkey if given a computer could do it

Medium - Monkey might struggle but could use an LLM to figure it out

Hard - Probably someone who's competent in the field would do this
